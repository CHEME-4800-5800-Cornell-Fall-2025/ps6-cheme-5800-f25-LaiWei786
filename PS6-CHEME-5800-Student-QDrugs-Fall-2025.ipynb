    "The Drug Cocktail Design Problem involves selecting a combination of drugs to create a cocktail that maximizes therapeutic effectiveness while staying within budget and safety constraints. Each drug has attributes such as dosage, mechanism of action, and side effects, which contribute to the overall effectiveness of the cocktail. The drug cocktail design problem can be formulated as the following optimization problem:\n",

Under the large budget, the agent can afford a multi-drug combination with mostly positive efficacy and achieves a positive Q-value, whereas under the small budget it switches to the cheapest, low-dose option even though its efficacy is negative, resulting in a much lower (negative) Q-value.

    "After setting the efficacy coefficients to include a strongly negative value for drug 2 (γ=[1.5,−2.0,0.8]) and retraining, I examined which drugs appear in the learned policy across all states. The selection counts were [2, 7, 18], indicating that the negative-γ drug (drug 2) was not completely excluded, but it appeared much less frequently than the positive-γ drugs. For the inspected state (s=15), the learned action selected drug 3 rather than drug 2, which is consistent with the overall trend. These results suggest the agent generally avoids negative-efficacy drugs, though they can still appear in a subset of states due to the discrete action space and trade-offs in the reward."

    "## Summary\n",
    "In this lab, we applied Q-learning to solve the drug cocktail design problem, learning optimal policies for selecting drug combinations and dosage levels under budget constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Key Takeaways:__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * **Q-learning for combinatorial optimization**: We implemented a Q-learning agent that iteratively estimates state-action value functions through temporal difference updates, converging to an optimal policy without requiring explicit knowledge of transition probabilities or reward functions. The algorithm balanced exploration (trying new drug combinations) with exploitation (selecting known effective combinations) using an epsilon-greedy strategy with a decaying exploration rate.\n",
    "> * **MDP formulation for drug design**: We encoded the drug cocktail problem as a Markov decision process with states representing dosage level configurations (high, nominal, low for each drug type), actions representing binary drug selection vectors, and rewards computed from Cobb-Douglas utility functions penalized for budget violations. This formulation captured both therapeutic effectiveness (through preference parameters γᵢ) and resource constraints (through budget limits).\n",
    "> * **Policy extraction and interpretation**: We derived the optimal policy by selecting argmax actions from the converged Q-value table, mapping each state to the drug combination that maximizes expected cumulative reward. The learned policy encoded both drug selection decisions (which drugs to include) and dosage optimization (which concentration levels to use), demonstrating how reinforcement learning discovers structured solutions to constrained combinatorial problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-learning provides a framework for sequential decision-making in optimization problems where the relationship between actions and outcomes must be learned through experience rather than analytical derivation.\n",
